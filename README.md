# Alternate Todo, an easy to use and accessible android app for creating and managing daily tasks #

## Introduction ##

Alternate Todo is an open-source and accessible Android app for creating and managing everyday tasks on a quick and easy way. I've started it as a free-time project when a friend of mine, who is also blind Android user like myself, was searching for such kind of app. Since he had lots of tasks to remember, he wanted an app that will be much easier to use than native Calendar apps, so I've tried to develope something for his needs. And, that's how this app was created.

Alternate Todo in it's 1.X release currently does not support notifications and alarms, but it certainly will in the future. It's currently good for people who just wanna enter tasks and review them later when they launch an app.

To run and compile the application, you need the following:

* If you're a blind developer, you need a physical Android device, running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean (API16) or later. A minimum Android version may change in the future if required. If you're sighted, feel free to use an emulator.
* Android Studio version 4.1 or later with latest Android SDK, latest Kotlin plugin and latest Gradle build system.
* Build tools V30.0.2 required
* Java JDK, version 8.
